.TH i3lock 1 "MARCH 2009" Linux "User Manuals"

.SH NAME
i3lock \- slightly improved version of slock

.SH SYNOPSIS
i3lock takes no arguments

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B i3lock
locks your screen by making it white. To quit
.B i3lock
just enter your password.

.SH DIFFERENCES TO SLOCK

.B i3lock
improves slock by making it fork() and therefore combinable with
commands to suspend your computer. Additionally, instead of turning of
your screen via DPMS and/or displaying a black screen,
.B i3lock
displays a white screen so you can see if your computer failed to resume
from suspend or if your screen is just locked. Also, when entering a wrong
password,
.B i3lock
does not call XBell(). This is important because
.B i3lock/slock
think you've entered a password when resuming from suspend, at least sometimes.

.B i3lock
was forked from slock-0.9
