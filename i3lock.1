.SH NAME
i3lock \- slightly improved version of slock

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B i3lock
.RB [\|\-v\|]
.RB [\|\-n\|]
.RB [\|\-b\|]
.RB [\|\-d\|]
.RB [\|\-i
.IR image.xpm \|]
.RB [\|\-c
.IR color \|]
.RB [\|\-t\|]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B i3lock
locks your screen by making it white (default). To quit
.B i3lock
just enter your password.

.SH DIFFERENCES TO SLOCK

.B i3lock
improves slock by making it fork() and therefore combinable with
commands to suspend your computer. Additionally, instead of turning off
your screen via DPMS and/or displaying a black screen,
.B i3lock
displays a white screen so you can see if your computer failed to resume
from suspend or if your screen is just locked. Also, when entering a wrong
password,
.B i3lock
does not call XBell(). This is important because
.B i3lock/slock
think you've entered a password when resuming from suspend, at least sometimes.

Since version 1.0, i3lock supports PAM.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Display the version of your
.B i3lock

.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nofork
Don't fork after starting.

.TP
.B \-b, \-\-beep
Enable beeping. Be sure to not do this when you are about to annoy other people,
like when opening your laptop in a boring lecture.

.TP
.B \-d, \-\-dpms
Enable turning off your screen using DPMS. Note that, when you do not specify this
option, DPMS will turn off your screen after 15 minutes of inactivity anyways (if
you did not disable this in your X server).

.TP
.B \-i, \-\-image
Display the given XPM image instead of a blank screen. You can convert an image to
XPM by using convert(1) from ImageMagick or GIMP for example.

.TP
.B \-c, \-\-color
Turns the screen into the given color instead of white. Color must be given in 6-byte format: rrggbb (i.e. ff0000 is red)

.TP
.B \-t, \-\-tiling
If an image is specified (via -i) it will display the image tiled all over the screen (if it is a multi-monitor setup, the image is visible on all screens)
>>>>>>> adding option to enable tiling of images:i3lock.1
