i3lock - slightly improved screen locker based on slock
============================
i3lock improves slock by making it fork() and therefore combinable with
commands to suspend your computer. Additionally, instead of turning off
your screen via DPMS and/or displaying a black screen, i3lock displays a
white screen so you can see if your computer failed to resume from suspend
or if your screen is just locked. Also, when entering a wrong password,
i3lock does not call XBell(). This is important because i3lock/slock think
youâ€™ve entered a password when resuming from suspend, at least sometimes.

i3lock was forked from slock-0.9

Requirements
------------
In order to build i3lock you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running i3lock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'i3lock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
